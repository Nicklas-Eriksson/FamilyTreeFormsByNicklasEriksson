# FamilyTreeFormsByNicklasEriksson

I have been using SQL stored procedure and dapper during this project.

To search chose from the scroll list what type of search you want to use, write in what you want to search and press "search".
Exampels for searches:
Nicklas Eriksson (got parents, sibblings and cousins).
198 (will display people born in the 1980s).
Eriksson (every one with a common surname).
Town name (will display people born and deceased in that town).

You can search for names, year or towns, or part of them, the searches will still come up if there are any match.

You can add/update/delete members from the family tree by selecting your chosen typ (Add/Update/Delete) from the list.
If you wish to delete or update a member, simply chose Update/Delete and pick a Persons name from the list down below.
When you are done editing you press the "OK" button.
